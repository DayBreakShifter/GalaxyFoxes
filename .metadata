  "description" : "[h1]NOTE: TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES[/h1]\nUpdates are going to be a bit more uncommon, due to the fact that my internet just suddenly decided it hates my computer. So I'm sorry for being off these last few weeks and for not updating this mod.\n\n[h1]None of the special armors are craftable as of this point in time.[/h1]\n\n[h1]About[/h1]\nThis mod adds three playable races to the roster: Eevees, Elysians, and Fennixes. I was inspired to make the original Eevee mod after I played the Umbreon and Lucario race mods, and from there, I just kept going.\n\n[h1]EEVEE[/h1]\nWhat once was a more animal-like race has recently taken a more humanoid form after thousands of years. Their ability to evolve through radiation was lost during this gradual shift, however, causing them to find other ways to survive. They are some of the few remaining Pokemon in the universe after the destruction of Earth, along with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1356955138]Lucario[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=730345787]Umbreon[/url]. They have since turned to living peacefully where they may not be disturbed. ... At least, most of them. Though some try to be heroes, others... Well, let's just say they go towards seeking more...\n\n[h1]FENNIX[/h1]\nThis subspecies of the normal Fennix was created through genetic mutation in an experiment to see if a seemingly non-sentient monster could start a civilization. After mercilessly burning their creators to ash, they did just that. Though initially a small race, and only able to flourish in warm climates, they have become skilled travelers and nomads of the stars. Some have even been brought into the Terrene Protectorate, trained to somewhat withstand harsher climates that would ordinarily cause them to perish in a single instant. \n\n[h1]ELYSIAN[/h1]\nA species that augmented their forms for survival, this species has been long since scattered throughout the universe. Some are more powerful than others, such as Lynx the swordmaster and Elise the smith. However, there are some who seek even more power, throwing ethics out the window in pursuit of infinite power. Some have even turned to aiding the Ruin, hoping that they will be granted what they seek in exchange. Most of this group, however, have twisted their forms, altering their very souls, becoming what are commonly called \"Corrupted Elysians\".\n\nCharacters [i]Shadow, Neo-Ka and Winter[/i] belong to [b]PKNerd[/b].\nArt is a collab between myself and [b]PKNerd[/b]\n\n[h1][u]NOTE: The Evolutionary Stones do not work like in the Pokemon games!
